tl;dr
ability to send posts in a quick embed in discord o:

You have to follow certain formatting points to make it work:

For the "Content/Details" your text has to be wrapped with « and »
 - Example: 

![« Only this content will send, in a good world POGGERS »](https://i.gyazo.com/631fa14296227e6560a1f7fa251c0fb0.png)

The Time & Location has to be like so:
 - ((OOC: 03-07-2022, Time: 12:00 PM, Location: Bubba's Wandering Trade Shop))

And invitations like:
 - LocationName - LocationLeaderName
 - Example: 

![LocationName - LocationLeaderName](https://i.gyazo.com/293caa8c8403c01b2b7476f446614513.png)

Everything else will be ignored.
Ofc, I can't host this bot because I have no money to pay for hosting, and really it is only useful if the community shows interest in it and wants to use it officially.
This is more of a neat little concept that I made while bored.
The code sucks.
